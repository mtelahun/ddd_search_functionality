# TDD Search Functionality

## [TDD Manifesto Excercise 4](https://tddmanifesto.com/exercises/)

Implement a city search functionality. The function takes a string (search text) as input and returns the found cities which corresponds to the search text.

### Prerequisites

Create a collection of strings that will act as a database for the city names.

City names: Paris, Budapest, Skopje, Rotterdam, Valencia, Vancouver, Amsterdam, Vienna, Sydney, New York City, London, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Dubai, Rome, Istanbul

### Requirements

1. If the search text is fewer than 2 characters, then should return no results. (It is an optimization feature of the search functionality.)
